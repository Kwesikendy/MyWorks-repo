Ok so this project is more or less a practice project for me to just polish my skills

So it is a chat webApp, something like whatsapp buh as a website...it has logins, signup features and has the main UI which can only let you search for friends,
send a request to them and also view your sent 
requests, received request and also your friends...it has sql tables that handle all the backend parts of it as well
Yh so in a nutshell that's all
